•	What I have implemented: I have changed my project topic from contact app to 
Weather forecast app.

•	What I have learned: I have learned to apply my app with different screen size such as iPhone, iPad and so on. And I have known how to use session info view.
•	What did work: Everything works very well this week, I just need to do more work on changing my topic. I have to pay more attention to the new topic.
•	What did not work: having some problems on finding related elements. I have to say Xamarin need more time to improve their functions

•	Time spent: I spent most of my time on the new topic, which is the weather forecast app. And I did go to the weekly practice session to finish my weekly practices.
•	Plan for next week: I will start to do the new topic from this week. Hopefully I can finish my design part and some of my coding part by next week.
